    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        Edges of the graph are expected to have an attribute called
        'capacity'. If this attribute is not present, the edge is
        considered to have infinite capacity.
            - If G is a directed graph, nothing further done
            - If G is an undirected graph, it is converted to a directed graph
              by replacing each undirected edge with two anti-directed parallel
              edges, both with equal capacity to the original undirected edge

    s : node
        Source node for the flow.

    t : node
        Sink node for the flow.



    max_out_cuts : terminates the recursive algorithm after finding this
                   number of near min cuts. It's important to give the algorithm
                   an escape since the size of the recursion tree is
                   exponential in the cardinality of (# of edges in) the min cut 

    **kwargs : 
    
        None: eps = 0

        eps : will return any cut between s and t whose capacity is 
              <=(1+eps)*C0 where C0 is the total cut capacity of the min cut

        eps_k : overrides eps if specified
                Will return any cut between s and t whose capacity is
                <=C0+eps_k


    Returns
    -------

    List of tuples [(cut_value, cutset)] : list of all near-min cuts

    cut_value : float
        Value of a near minimal cut, i.e., sum of the capacities of the edges
        that were cut

    cutset : set of 2-tuples
        A set of edges that were cut

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        An argument other than eps or eps_k was passed to kwargs

    NetworkXError
        The algorithm does not support MultiGraph and MultiDiGraph. If
        the input graph is an instance of one of these two classes, a
        NetworkXError is raised.

    NetworkXUnbounded
        If the graph has a path of infinite capacity, the value of a
        feasible flow on the graph is unbounded above and the function
        raises a NetworkXUnbounded.
